# Basic Logically Equivalent Python and Rust programs

## Overview
This repo includes some extremely basic but highly scalable programs / algorithms, translated 1:1 in Python and Rust. The Python and Rust programs are completely logically equivalent. Useful for comparing runtimes / mem usage / other performance states, and for testing at scale.

Includes algorithms involving string handling and integer handling.

## Purpose
These files were used to check large performance differences between Python and Rust and perfom scale tests in a research project comparing their performances. While more robust tests were performed for the actual research on professional testing software, these programs are basic enough that large performance differences can be seen on fairly rudimentary hardware.

Originally, it was used to formulate hypotheses for the research project, which were later tested thoroughly with more complex programs. The programs here can be easily modified or used for similar projects.
